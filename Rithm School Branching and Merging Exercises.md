#Branching and Merging Exercises

**Part I**

1. git clean removes untracked files from the working tree
2. -d removes untracked directories in addition to untracked files; -f forces git to delete directories and files
3. git checkout -b
4. A fast-forward merge only occurs when there have not been any commits on the original branch and the working branch is ahead of the original branch. A recursive merge occurs when trying to merge multiple branches with multiple commits to the original branch; in such a situation, Git is unable to determine the order of the commits.
5. git checkout NAME_OF_FILE
6. git clean -df
7. git branch -D NAME_OF_BRANCH
8. It shows the difference between two commits.
9. git rm --cached
10. Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to determine which file or folder takes precedence in the merge when there have been multiple commits with changes to the same file or folder.

**Part II**
